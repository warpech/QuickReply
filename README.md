# Quick Reply

A Chrome/Firefox extension for GitHub

For any GitHub issue, this extension provides a button "Quick Reply":

- I think this issue can be closed.
   - (period)
   - ...because the problem is solved.
   - ...because all of the items are tracked in other issues.
- Closing as done.
- This PR is was not updated in a while. Code starts to smell.

If the issue includes the phrase "I think this issue can be closed" 3 times the reply will also close the issue with a nuke icon.

The extension also provides a leader board (users who have the most quick replies).
